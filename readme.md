# Android Clean Architecture Boilerplate

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ We hope this boilerplate is not only helpful to other developers, but also that it helps to enducate in the area of architecture.We created this boilerplate for a few reasons:

1. To experiment with modularisation
2. To share some approaches to clean architecture, especially as we've been [talking a lot about it](https://academy.realm.io/posts/converting-an-app-to-use-clean-architecture/)
3. To use as a starting point in future projects where clean architecture feels appropriate

It is written in 100% kotlin with both UI and Unit tests - we will also be keeping this up-to-date as libraries change!

### Disclaimer

Note: The use of clean architecture may seem over-complicated for this sample project. However, this allows us to keep the amount of boilerplate code to a minimum and also demonstrate the approach in a simpler form.

Clean Architecture will not be appropriate for every project, so it is down to you to decide whether or not it fits your needs ðŸ™‚
